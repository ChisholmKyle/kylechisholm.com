I'm interested in robotics and tech, especially human-centered applications like surgical robotics, assistive and rehabilitation robotics, and collaborative robots. I love solving hard problems related to motion control, sensing and robotics and meeting the needs of clients who interact with the features and products I've worked on over the years. A little more info on my work is provided below. You can access [my resume here](./assets/pdf/cv_kyle_chisholm.pdf).
